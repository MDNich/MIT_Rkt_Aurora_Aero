 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.219   TIME= 16:59:31
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 One or more single layer Shell elements (such as element 1) reference   
 section 3, which defines a different material (2) than the attribute    
 of the element (1).

 The value of UZ at node 2 is 1000007.83.  It is greater than the        
 current limit of 1000000 (which can be reset on the NCNV command).      
 This generally indicates rigid body motion as a result of an            
 unconstrained model.  Verify that your model is properly constrained.
